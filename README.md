# Zeta
Zeta is a helper tool built for C/C++ developers built by a C/C++ developer.

## Why zeta?
I like to write a lot of C/C++ programs. Setting up a new workspace for each project becomes a hassle once you start doing many projects. That's the sole reason why Zeta exists. It tries to eliminate the preparing part of your C/C++ program by setting up a workspace with all the necessary files and folder.

## Installation
Zeta is in its early stages and there might be a few bugs.
It is still very usable and can be used in general development.
